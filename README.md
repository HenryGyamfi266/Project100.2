# Project Overview

## Performance Comparison of Sorting Algorithms in Data Security Applications
This project is a Python program that visually compares three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Python's built-in sort. 
It uses a GUI created with the BreezyPythonGUI library. The application:

Generates Random Lists: Three sets of random integers are created with sizes of 100, 1000, and 2000 elements.
Implements Sorting Algorithms: It sorts these lists using Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Python's built-in sort method.
Records Time Taken: The GUI displays the time taken by each sorting method for each list size, allowing the user to compare their efficiency.
The purpose is to provide a simple visual comparison of sorting algorithm performance.
